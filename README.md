# Companion .NET
*Companion .NET* is a collection of C# libraries that are aimed to make *Blazor-based* web development easier.

## Contained libraries
Currently, only the *Companion.Signaling*-API is implemented.

### Companion .NET Signaling
*Companion .NET Signaling* provides an API for change detection, therefore adds the possability to re-render components only when it is actually necessary ([see more](./src/Signaling/src/README.md)).
The corresponding documentation can be found [here](./docs/Signaling/BasicConcepts.md).
